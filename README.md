# Runescape Inspired Store

This mock web store was made for [The Odin Project curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-shopping-cart).

## Features
***
* Custom number input for adding items to cart
* Dynamically created product display pages (click the image of any item in the shop!)
* Search bar in shop to filter by name OR item type (try searching for armor)
* Accurate display of the number of items in the user's cart on the navbar
* Total price calculation of both items and the entire cart
* Mock checkout to empty the user's cart

Pretty cool, right?
That's not even including the dancing man on the homepage.
